### Data

The dataset consists of approximately 4000 data points, with each datapoint having 9 features hosted on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone.

**Features**
- Sex - Sex of the Abalone - Male, Female, Infant - Categorical
- Length - Length of the Abalone - Continuous
- Diameter - Diameter of the Abalone - Continuouss
- Height - Height of the Abalone - Continuous
- Whole_weight - Meat weight + Shell weight of the Abalone - Continuous
- Shucked_weight - Weight of the outer covering (shuck) of the Abalone - Continuous
- Viscera_weight - Weight of the meat of the Abalone - Continuous
- Shell_weight - Shell weight of the Abalone - Continuous

**Target Variable**
- Rings - Number of rings + 1.5 years gives the age of the Abalone - Continuous
